# FuncList
Retrieves functions, symbols, bookmarks from text or source files and lists references in a side editor. Clicking a references will reveal the corresponding position in text or source file.

- open a C source file  
  see [Examples](#examples) for different file settings
- select `F1 > Show Functions`
- a side editor opens and shows a functions reference list
- click a reference

# Settings
__.vscode/settings.json__

    "funcList.nativeFilter": "",
    "funcList.displayFilter": "",
    "funcList.sortList": 1

`nativeFilter`  
regular expression to match functions, symbols, bookmarks  
_(nativeFilter does not allow regEx groups)_

`displayFilter`  
regular expression to trim matches of nativeFilter for clean display  
_(displayFilter allows regEx groups 0-9 in options, see examples)_

`sortList`  
0 = natural (order of appearance)  
1 = alphabetic

# Examples
### TypeScript Filter

    "funcList.nativeFilter": "/(?:^|\\s)function\\s+\\w+\\(/mg"

`function encodeLocation(`  
`function dispose(`  
simple functions will be found

    "funcList.displayFilter": "/\\s*function\\s+(\\w+)/1"

`encodeLocation`  
`dispose`  
function names without keyword and opening bracket will be displayed

### Simple C Function Filter
    "funcList.nativeFilter": "/^[a-z]+\\s+\\w+\\(/mgi"

`int main(`  
`void initSerial(`  
simple function headers will be found

    "funcList.displayFilter": "/\\S* +(\\w+)/1"

`main`  
`initSerial`  
function names without return value and opening bracket will be displayed

### Assembler Target Filter
    "funcList.nativeFilter": "/^\\w+:\\s*$/mg"

`encodeByte:`  
`doSleep:`  
standalone targets on beginning of lines are found

`mar01: mov r0,r1`  
`abc17: ;comment`  
targets with following instruction or comment are not found

    "funcList.displayFilter": "/\\w+/"
    
`encodeByte`  
`doSleep`  
targets are listed without colon or trailing spaces

### Bookmark Filter
    "funcList.nativeFilter": "/^bookmark .+$/mg"

`bookmark my mark 123`  
`bookmark huubaBooba`  
or similar will be found

    "funcList.displayFilter": "/\\w+\\s+(.*\\w)/1"

`my mark 123`  
`huubaBooba`  
will be listed

# Hints
- reference lists contribute two context menu entries  
  _'Switch Sort'_ for switching sort mode  
  _'Refresh'_ for manual refreshing the reference list
- reference list tab names are surrounded by brackets
- reference lists are read only
- multiple found references are marked with bracketed numbers  
  they are selectable with consecutive clicks  
- multiple lists can exist for one source file
- to avoid reload of reference list files change user settings to  
  `"files.hotExit": "off"`

# Flaws
- avoid editing reference lists  
  references may mess up (-> [History](#history))  
  vsCode API has no possibility to make untitled file scheme documents read only
- closing reference lists or vsCode will pop up a save dialog  
  (pressing 'Save' will not save the list)
- wrong formulated regular expressions may cause unpredictable display results

# History
- __V0.5__  
  based on document content provider  
  reference lists are read only and have to be closed and reopened for refresh and therefore loose user set width 
- __V0.6__  
  based on untitled file scheme  
  reference lists are editable and refresh keeps user set width (-> [Flaws](#flaws))
- __V0.6.1__  
  strip CR and LF from native filter to resolve [Issue 1](https://github.com/qrti/funcList/issues/1)

  revised examples
  
# How to run locally
- `npm run compile`  
to start the compiler in watch mode
- open this folder in vsCode and press `F5`
